# 999 Emergency

999 Emergency is a pack of Photon enabled British Emergency Vehicles.

## Our Aims

- To bring the Garry's Mod community a realistic fleet of United Kingdom vehicles, from different areas and agencies. Handcrafted lighting using a range of custom made components including Skins made with love and care.
- To redefine and recreate Photon Vehicles and skins made previously, to bring them up to the realistic feeling and standards that the people and ourselves want.

### Our Goal

Our end goal is to have a massive ELS lighting pack dedicated and packed of UK vehicles for the community to enjoy and use.

## Why?

**Why are we doing this?**
That is an excellent question; certain members of the UK RP community were annoyed with the lack of *REALISTIC* vehicles that truly show the UK in its full force and greatness, so a small team of people wanted to change that and make new, improved and generally better UK vehicles; this is when 999 Emergency was formed.
We wanted to also name ourselves after something that you could easily connect to the UK and Emergency services. So we thought of 999 Emergency, with hopes that people could easily see that it is related to the UK and their Emergency Services.
